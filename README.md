# Anomaly-Detection
Code to incorporate results from EVT (Extreme Value Theory) into the objective of an LSTM deep learning model to perform anomaly detection is given. To explore an EVT objective, we have borrowed insights from Siffer et al (2017) https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3097983.3098144 and their SPOT algorithm. At present, we have provided only the partial code to give an idea on how to modify the objective function of a deep learning model for anomaly detection. Complete code will be updated soon.
